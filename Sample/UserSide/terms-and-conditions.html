    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Cindy's Bakeshop Hagonoy online services. By creating an account, placing an order, or otherwise using this site, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please discontinue using our services.</p>

    <p>Orders placed through our platform are considered offers to purchase our products. We reserve the right to accept or decline any order. Prices, product availability, and promotional offers may change without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>3. Face Capture and Identity Verification</h2>
    <p>To help protect our community and improve order verification, we may request a facial image during account signup or before pickup. Face capture data is handled with particular care:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collection:</strong> We collect a single facial image solely for identity confirmation and fraud prevention. We do not capture live video.</li>
      <li><strong>Use:</strong> The facial image is only compared to the image you provide and is not used for automated decision-making beyond confirming your identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage and Retention:</strong> Face capture images are encrypted at rest and automatically deleted within 30 days after verification is completed or your account is closed, whichever occurs first.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> By submitting a facial image, you confirm that you are the rightful owner of the image and consent to our use of it for verification. You may contact us to request deletion sooner, subject to legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Third Parties:</strong> We do not sell or share facial images with advertisers. Access is limited to trained staff who require it to complete verification.</li>
    </ul>
